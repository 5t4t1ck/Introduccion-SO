abstract = {This chapter covers three of the most exciting and demanding classes of cloud applications: Big Data, data streaming, and mobile cloud computing. Big Data and data-streaming applications require low-latency, scalability, versatility, and a high degree of fault tolerance. Achieving these qualities at scale is extremely challenging. The defining attributes of Big Data are analyzed in Section 12.1. The next sections discuss how Big Data is stored and processed. High-capacity datastores and databases are necessary to store the very large volumes of data. Scaling data warehouses and databases poses its own challenges. The Mesa datastore and Spanner and F1 databases developed at Google are discussed in Section 12.2, while another class of Big Data applications, combining mathematical modeling with simulation and measurements, and the dynamic, data-driven applications (DDAS), are discussed in Section 12.3. Clouds host several classes of data-streaming applications, ranging from content-delivery data streaming to applications consuming a continuous stream of events. Such applications are discussed in Sections 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices, are ubiquitous and indispensable for living in a modern society. Mobile devices are in a symbiotic relationship with computer clouds, and their users benefit from the democratization of data processing. The user of a mobile device has access to the vast amounts of computing cycles and storage available on computer clouds. Mobile cloud computing enables the execution of mobile applications on mobile devices and on computer clouds. Mobile devices act as producers and consumers of the data stored on clouds and shared with others. Section 12.7 is an introduction to mobile computing and its applications, while Section 12.8 covers energy efficiency of mobile computing. Section 12.9 analyzes the effects of latency and presents alternative mobile computing models including cloudlets. Scale allows us to add mission-critical applications demanding very high availability, a topic discussed in Section 12.10. Scale amplifies variability often causing heavy-tail distributions of critical performance metrics as in the case of latency discussed in Section 12.11. Edge computing and Markov decision processes are analyzed in Section 12.12. Bootstrapping techniques for data analytics and approximate query processing are covered in Sections 12.13 and 12.14. Further readings and exercises and problems comprise Sections 12.15 and 12.16.}
